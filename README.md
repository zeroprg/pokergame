Joe, 3H, 4H, 5H, 6H, 8H •
Bob, 3C, 3D, 3S, 8C, 10D •

Appendix: 
Terminology: Cards have a suit and a number (called the value or rank). The possible suits are hearts (H), clubs (C), spades (S), and diamonds (D). The possible ranks are 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9,10, Jack (J), Queen (Q), King (K), and Ace (A).  
Poker hands: The following are the poker hands, from best to worst: 
 Straight flush: Five cards of the same suit in sequence (if those five are A, K, Q, J, 10; it is a Royal Flush)
Four of a kind: Four cards of the same rank, and any one other card 
 Full house: Three cards of one rank and two of another
 Flush: Five cards of the same suit  Straight: Five cards in sequence (for example, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8), but not all of the same suit
 Three of a kind: Three cards of the same rank  Two pair: Two cards of one rank and two cards of another  
One pair: Two cards of the same rank  High card: If no one has one pair or a better hand, the highest card wins
